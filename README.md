Cellenics Developer Documentation
=================================

Welcome to the developer documentation for Cellenics -- the first cloud-based open source web platform for single cell RNA sequencing data analysis. It allows anyone to easily turn their big datasets into meaningful biology and make discoveries. The core contributors are a [team](https://www.biomage.net/our-team) of mission oriented software engineers, bioinformaticians and researchers who are trying to accelerate scientific research with the aim of improving human health.

Quickstart
----------

In order to get a working development environment run `./install-deps.sh` script. It will set up and install the dependencies and clone the required repositories.
